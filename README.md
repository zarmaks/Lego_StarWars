Welcome to an exploratory project where we piece together LEGO's history, with a keen eye on 1999â€”a year that transformed LEGO with the introduction of Star Wars sets. This project is a blend of data wrangling, trend analysis, and visual storytelling. You'll find insightful bar charts comparing the Star Wars themes to the average year's offerings and histograms that reveal the fluctuating diversity of LEGO themes over time. It's a comprehensive analysis that offers a deeper understanding of LEGO's evolution, especially for the Star Wars saga within the LEGO world.
